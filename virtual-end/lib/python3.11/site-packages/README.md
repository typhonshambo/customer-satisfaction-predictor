# ü§ñ Introduction

ü§π ZenML is an extensible, open-source MLOps framework for creating portable,
production-ready machine learning pipelines. By decoupling infrastructure from
code, ZenML enables developers across your organization to collaborate more
effectively as they develop to production.

- üíº ZenML gives data scientists the freedom to fully focus on modeling and
experimentation while writing code that is production-ready from the get-go.

- üë®‚Äçüíª ZenML empowers ML engineers to take ownership of the entire ML lifecycle
  end-to-end. Adopting ZenML means fewer handover points and more visibility on
  what is happening in your organization.

- üõ´ ZenML enables MLOps infrastructure experts to define, deploy, and manage
sophisticated production environments that are easy to use for colleagues.

# üõ†Ô∏è Why ZenML?

![Walkthrough of ZenML Model Control Plane (Dashboard available only on ZenML Cloud)](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/mcp_walkthrough.gif)

ZenML offers a systematic approach to structuring your machine learning codebase for a seamless transition to production. It's an ideal solution for teams grappling with establishing an internal standard for coordinating ML operations. ZenML provides not just a tool, but a workflow strategy that guides you in integrating all your tools and infrastructure effectively.

Use ZenML if:

- You need to easily automate ML workflows on services like an Airflow cluster or AWS Sagemaker Pipelines.
- Your ML tasks require repeatability and reproducibility.
- Automating and standardizing ML workflows across your team is a challenge.
- Your team integrates multiple tools with no central platform.
- You'd like a single place to track data, code, configuration, and models along with your cloud artifact storage.
- Collaboration and hand-overs between multiple teams is difficult.

# ‚òÑÔ∏è What makes ZenML different?

![Before and after ZenML](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/zenml-why.png)

ZenML marries the capabilities of a classic pipeline tool like [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) and a metadata tracking service like [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/). Furthermore, both these types of tools can seamlessly co-exist with ZenML, providing a comprehensive, end-to-end ML experience.

It excels at:

- Enabling creation of simple, pythonic [ML pipelines](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide/create-an-ml-pipeline) that function locally and on any [orchestration backend](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/production-guide/cloud-orchestration).
- Automating versioning of [data](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide/manage-artifacts) and [models](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide/track-ml-models) on [remote artifact storage like S3](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/production-guide/remote-storage).
- Abstracting infrastructure and run configuration from code through a [simple YAML config](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/advanced-guide/pipelining-features/configure-steps-pipelines).
- Logging complex [metadata](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/advanced-guide/data-management/logging-metadata) for models and artifacts.
- Automatically containerizing and deploying your workflows to the cloud, connected to your [code repository](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/production-guide/connect-code-repository).
- Connecting your [secret store](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/advanced-guide/secret-management) to your ML workflows.

However, ZenML doesn't:

- Automatically create visuals and track experiments: It [integrates with experiment trackers](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks-and-components/component-guide/experiment-trackers) that specialize in this task.
- Package and deploy models: ZenML catalogs models and metadata, streamlining model deployment. Refer to [ZenML model deployers](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks-and-components/component-guide/model-deployers) for more information.
- Handle distributed computation: While ZenML pipelines scale vertically with ease, it [works with tools like Spark](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks-and-components/component-guide/step-operators/spark-kubernetes) for intricate distributed workflows.

# ü§∏ Quickstart

[Install ZenML](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/installation) via
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/zenml/). Python 3.8 - 3.11 is required:

```bash
pip install "zenml[server]"
# you'll also need the `notebook` package installed to run Jupyter notebooks:
# OPTIONALLY: `pip install notebook`
```

Take a tour with the guided quickstart by running:

```bash
zenml go
```

# üîã Deploy ZenML

For full functionality ZenML should be deployed on the cloud to
enable collaborative features as the central MLOps interface for teams.

<div align="center">
  <img width="60%" src="docs/book/.gitbook/assets/Scenario3.png" alt="ZenML Architecture Diagram."/>
</div>

Currently, there are two main options to deploy ZenML:

- **ZenML Cloud**: With [ZenML Cloud](cloud.zenml.io/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=referral_link&utm_campaign=cloud_promotion&utm_content=signup_link), 
you can utilize a control plane to create ZenML servers, also known as tenants. 
These tenants are managed and maintained by ZenML's dedicated team, alleviating 
the burden of server management from your end. 

- **Self-hosted deployment**: Alternatively, you have the flexibility to [deploy 
ZenML on your own self-hosted environment](https://docs.zenml.io/deploying-zenml/zenml-self-hosted). 
This can be achieved through various methods, including using our CLI, Docker, 
Helm, or HuggingFace Spaces.

# üñºÔ∏è Learning

The best way to learn about ZenML is the [docs](https://docs.zenml.io). We recommend beginning with the [Starter Guide](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide) to get up and running quickly.

For inspiration, here are some other examples and use cases:

1. [E2E Batch Inference](examples/e2e/): Feature engineering, training, and inference pipelines for tabular machine learning.
2. [Basic NLP with BERT](examples/e2e_nlp/): Feature engineering, training, and inference focused on NLP.
3. [LLM RAG Pipeline with Langchain and OpenAI](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/tree/main/llm-agents): Using Langchain to create a simple RAG pipeline.
4. [Huggingface Model to Sagemaker Endpoint](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/tree/main/huggingface-sagemaker): Automated MLOps on Amazon Sagemaker and HuggingFace.

# Use ZenML with VS Code

ZenML has a [VS Code
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZenML.zenml-vscode)
that allows you to inspect your stacks and pipeline runs directly from your
editor. The extension also allows you to switch your stacks without needing to
type any CLI commands.

# üó∫ Roadmap

ZenML is being built in public. The [roadmap](https://zenml.io/roadmap) is a
regularly updated source of truth for the ZenML community to understand where
the product is going in the short, medium, and long term.

ZenML is managed by a [core team](https://zenml.io/company) of
developers that are responsible for making key decisions and incorporating
feedback from the community. The team oversees feedback via various channels,
and you can directly influence the roadmap as follows:

- Vote on your most wanted feature on our [Discussion
  board](https://zenml.io/discussion).
- Start a thread in our [Slack channel](https://zenml.io/slack).
- [Create an issue](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/issues/new/choose) on our
  GitHub repo.
